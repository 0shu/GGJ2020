Made for the Global Game Jam 2020 by students at De Montfort University

## Getting Started

The master branch should have the latest "stable" build on it.
To develop this project you will need to have Unity 2019.3 installed on your computer!
To play this project you just have to go into the builds folder and run the exe (warning might not exist yet).

### Merging

The general protocol for branching/merging is as follows:
```
- Develop in your own branch.
- When you're ready to add it to master merge FROM master onto your branch
- Test all your stuff still works, fix any bugs BEFORE pushing
- Merge from your fixed branch back to master
```

## Built With
